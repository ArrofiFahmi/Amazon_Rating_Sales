# The Analysis
## 1. What is the average of all products by category?
To identify and calculate all rating products by category, i use scatter plot to show how distribution the product based on rating and rating count by category. This visualization can be easily to understand with coloring the plot by category.
### Data Visualization and Results
```python
hue_colors={"Car&Motorbike":"blue", 
            "Computers&Accessories":"green",
            "Electronics":"red",
            "Health&PersonalCare":"cyan",
            "Home&Kitchen":"magenta",
            "HomeImprovement":"yellow",
            "MusicalInstruments":"black",
            "OfficeProducts":"olive",
            "Toys&Games":"grey"}
sns.scatterplot(x="rating", y="rating_count", data=df, hue="product_category", palette=hue_colors)
plt.show()
```

#### Key Observations:
  - Rating : The product ratings range from 2.0 to 5.0, with most data points concentrated between 3.5 and 5.0.
  - Rating Count : The number of ratings varies widely, reaching up to 400,000+ for some products.
  - Category Diversity: Different categories, such as Electronics, Home&Kitchen, and Health&PersonalCare, dominate the distribution. Each is color-coded for better   distinction.
#### Key Analysis:
  1. Distribution Across Categories:
      - Electronics (red):This category has a strong presence, with some products achieving very high rating counts (above 300,000). These are typically highly rated (4.0â€“4.5), indicating both popularity and customer satisfaction.
      - Computers&Accessories (green): While not as widespread as Electronics, this category shows consistent ratings between 3.5 and 4.5. Some items have notable review counts (~100,000+).
      - Home&Kitchen (pink): Products in this category are clustered between ratings of 3.5 and 4.5, with review counts mostly under 100,000.
  2. High Rating Count Products:
     - A few products, particularly in Electronics and Health&PersonalCare, stand out with exceptionally high rating counts, suggesting strong market engagement.
  3. General Trends:
     - A significant proportion of products, across most categories, have ratings clustered around 4.0 to 4.5, which is typical for popular and well-regarded items.
     - Products rated below 3.0 are sparse, indicating that poorly rated products may not gain substantial customer attention.
### Summary
The scatter plot highlights how Amazon product ratings and review counts are distributed across various categories. Electronics and Health&PersonalCare stand out for their popularity, with some products attracting massive customer engagement. Categories like Home&Kitchen show a broad yet moderate performance. This data can be used to identify high-performing categories and pinpoint areas for further improvement or market focus.

## 2. What is the relationship between the discounted price and the number of ratings?
To see how far the effect from the relationship is to getting insgiht for better action.
